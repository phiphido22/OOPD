# OOPD
Brief: This program creates classes which manages two types of ships, Submarines and Fighter Jets for a simulation. The program should be able to store details of the submarines and fighter jets, read details from an input file, add a ship based on user input, determine which stored ship will reach a specified destination first, display all ships in storage and save all ships to a file.

Files: This project is split into 2 main directories, the main Assignment
